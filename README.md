# Beijing Air Pollution -- updated 12/12/2019

This project aims to answer one quesion: Is Beijing's air quality better?

The original data is from the Beijing municipal enviromental monitoring center. They published hourly data from 36 detectors all over Beijing from 2015 to 2018. The types of pollutants the data includes are PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2 and others.

I used pandas to clean and analyze the data. In building the charts, I used matplotlib, Adobe illustrator and ai2html. For the maps, I used Qgis, Adobe illustrator, Mapbox and D3.js.
